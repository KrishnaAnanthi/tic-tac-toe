# TicTacToe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a game played between two players on a 3Ã—3 board. The two players take turns to put pieces on the board. A single piece is put for each turn and piece once put does not move. A player wins the game by first lining three of his or her pieces in a straight line, no matter horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
